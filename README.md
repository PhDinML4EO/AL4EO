# AL4EO

AL4EO is an Active Learning Toolbox for Earth Observation. 

## Reference 

This toolbox was used for our review paper in Geoscience and Remote Sensing Magazine:

> R. Thoreau, V. Achard, L. Risser, B. Berthelot and X. Briottet, "*Active Learning for Hyperspectral Image Classification: a Comparative Review*," in IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Magazine, in review.

This toolbox also includes:

 * Our preprocessing method to handle large datasets:

 * Probabilistic Breaking Tie, an active learning strategy to lerverage class hierarchy:
